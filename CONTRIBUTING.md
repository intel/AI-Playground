# Contributing to AI Playground

First off, thank you for considering contributing to AI Playground. It's people like you that make this project such a great tool. We welcome contributions from everyone as long as they follow the guidelines below.

## Code of Conduct

AI Playground has adopted a Code of Conduct that we expect project participants to adhere to. Please read [the full text](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) so that you can understand what actions will and will not be tolerated.

## How to Contribute

There are many ways to contibute to this project, from writing tutorials or blog posts ([Show and tell in Discussion](https://github.com/intel/AI-Playground/discussions)), improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests, or writing code which can be incorporated into this project itself.

### Reporting Bugs

Before submitting bug reports, please check the [issue](https://github.com/intel/AI-Playground/issues) tracker to make sure the bug hasn't been reported before. If it is a new bug, please provide as much detail as possible, including:

- A clear and descriptive title
- The exact steps which reproduce the problem
- Your environment (OS, GPU, CPU, etc.)
- Any related files or screenshots

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions (feature requests) are also tracked as GitHub [issues](https://github.com/intel/AI-Playground/issues). When suggesting an enhancement, please:

- Use a clear and descriptive title
- Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement
- Explain why this enhancement would be useful to most AI Playground users

### Pull Requests

If you are not familiar with pull requests, you could get started with GitHub tutorials: [Collaborate with pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/about-collaborative-development-models).

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain the quality of this project
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible AI Playground
- Enable a sustainable system for AI Playground's maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Always set base branch to [dev](https://github.com/intel/AI-Playground/tree/dev), do NOT make pull requests to the main branch without a strong reason.
2. Follow all instructions in [the template](/.github/pull_request_template.md).
3. After you submit your pull request, verify that all [status checks](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/collaborating-on-repositories-with-code-quality-features/about-status-checks) are passing.
4. [Sign your work](/CONTRIBUTING.md#sign-your-work).

While the prerequisites above must be satifisfied prior to have your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.

## Sign your work

Please use the sign-off line at the end of the patch. Your signature certifies that you wrote the patch or otherwise have the right to pass it on as an open-source patch. The rules are pretty simple: if you can certify

```

    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
    license and I have the right under that license to submit that
    work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
    by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
    permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
    in the file; or
